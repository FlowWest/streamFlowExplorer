Ecological Monitoring,Single system/Regional Analysis,Studying the impact of streamflow changes on aquatic ecosystems,"Empirical flow data (USGS, CDEC)","Fine resolution for modeling, provides hourly or daily flow data for a specific system, Fine resolution is critical for biological conditions modeling","Availability and coverage varies by system, there are data gaps on some streams (data gaps make it challenging for regional analysis)"
Ecological Monitoring,Single system/Regional Analysis,Analyzing long-term trends in streamflow data to understand the effects of climate change on aquatic ecosystems.,"Empirical flow data (USGS, CDEC)","Fine resolution for modeling, provides hourly or daily flow data for a specific system, Fine resolution is critical for biological conditions modeling","Availability and coverage varies by system, there are data gaps on some streams (data gaps make it challenging for regional analysis)"
Ecological Monitoring,Regional analysis,Analyzing long-term trends in streamflow data to understand the effects of climate change on aquatic ecosystems.,CalSim and SacWam,"Full coverage of system and no data gaps because it is modeled data, Can utilize different operations simulations to see how that changes ecosystem dynamics, Provides additional information on deliveries","Monthly timestep is limiting, misses critical flow events that may drive population dynamics"
Ecological Monitoring,Single system,Hydraulic modeling for planning restoration project,"Empirical flow data (USGS, CDEC)","Fine resolution for modeling, provides hourly or daily flow data for a specific system, may be important to plan how a project would react to different restoration scenarios","Availability and coverage varies by system, there are data gaps on some streams"
Ecological Monitoring,Single system,Hydraulic modeling for planning restoration project,CalSim and SacWam,Can utilize different operations simulations to see how that changes flow dynamics,"Monthly timestep is limiting, misses critical flow events that may have an important impact on hydraulic modeling"
Water Resource Management,Regional analysis,"Assessing water availability for agriculture, urban use, and ecosystems.","Empirical flow data (USGS, CDEC)",,"Empirical data describes current conditions, it does not allow for testing various operations"
Water Resource Management,Regional analysis,"Assessing water availability for agriculture, urban use, and ecosystems.",CalSim and SacWam,Built for testing various operations scenarios,"Only avaliable for certain scenarios, High level of effort and expertise to model additional operations scenarios"
