<p>California Simulation (CalSim) is a water resources planning model of
the Central Valley Project (CVP) and State Water Project (SWP)
operations.</p>
<p>CalSim simulates the operations of the State Water Project (SWP) and
the Central Valley Project (CVP), along with much of the water resources
infrastructure in the Central Valley of California and the
Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta region. It models various aspects of water
management, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>water storage,</li>
<li>conveyance,</li>
<li>deliveries,</li>
<li>hydropower generation,</li>
<li>and flows</li>
</ul>

<p>Watersheds in CalSim are categorized as either Rim or Valley Floor
watersheds.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rim: foothill and mountain watersheds characterized by steep slopes,
shallow soils, limited aquifer, not developed</li>
<li>Valley Floor: located between Upper watersheds and Delta;
extensively developed, highly managed, rich agricultural land, urban
areas</li>
</ul>
<p>CalSim 3 uses defined Water Budget Areas (WBA), that have been
developed to help define the enhanced spatial resolution of CalSim 3.
WBAs are used to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide a structure to simplify the organization, explanation, and
presentation of CalSim 3 data, code, and results.</li>
<li>Define the boundary of non-district agricultural water users within
a region who are aggregated to a single demand unit in CalSim 3.</li>
<li>Define the boundary of scattered water users whose water supplies
for domestic (or industrial) use are self-produced, who rely on
groundwater, and who are represented in CalSim 3 by a single demand
unit.</li>
<li>Define the spatial resolution of hydrologic input data for
calculating agricultural demands (i.e., precipitation and
evapotranspiration (ET)).</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the refined spatial scale is organized around demand
units are formulated so that water users within a demand unit have
similar water rights, water contracts, source(s) of water, soils, land
use, and general water delivery and irrigation efficiencies. Demand
units are the smallest computational unit and are generated based on the
following data sources:</p>
<ul>
<li>Water district and water agency boundaries and service areas
obtained from the Cal-Atlas Geospatial Clearinghouse (formerly the
California Spatial Information Library), which comprises separate GIS
layers for Federal, State, and private water districts. These data are
also available from DWR (2022a).</li>
<li>County LAFCO reports on water purveyors in their respective counties
(LAFCO, 2022).0F</li>
<li>County land-use surveys undertaken by DWR’s Division of Regional
Assistance (formerly Division of Planning and Local Assistance) (DWR,
2022b).</li>
<li>County and regional integrated water resources plans and integrated
water management plans.</li>
<li>CalSim II documentation (Reclamation, 2007).</li>
<li>Reclamation CVP water supply contract renewal and supporting

<p>CalSim is developed in the form of a node-arc network where nodes
represent specific locations and arcs represent flow between nodes, <a href="https://data.cnra.ca.gov/dataset/2395530a-5421-487e-921e-d6e594f23ac6/resource/3ec8338e-31d9-4dd3-93df-8d60ee6ec3d2/download/cs3_networkschematic_integrated_10_11_2022.pdf" class="external-link">here</a>

<h3 id="assumptions">Assumptions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#assumptions"></a>
</h3>
<p>Hydroloic Modeling assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first assumption categorizes foothill and mountainous ‘rim’
watersheds surrounding the Central Valley as relatively undeveloped,
with minimal changes in land use over time affecting natural outflows.
These watersheds typically exhibit complex topography, steep slopes,
shallow soils, and limited groundwater aquifer systems. Runoff in these
areas is predominantly influenced by the snowfall and snowmelt cycle,
with precipitation quickly returning to streams as baseflow. Groundwater
is not extensively utilized as a water supply source in these upland
watersheds.</li>
<li>The second assumption pertains to the ‘valley floor’ watersheds,
which have undergone extensive agricultural development and include
significant urban areas. Human impacts on the environment strongly
influence the timing and volume of runoff in these areas. Deep
percolation from precipitation and irrigation contributes to aquifer
recharge, which is closely connected to the stream system. Groundwater
serves as a crucial water source for both agricultural and urban
purposes, leading to significant changes in groundwater storage over
time.</li>

<p>Rim watersheds - modeled using unimpaired runoff, utilize gage data
directly where available to create a preprocessed time series of
unimpaired runoff. This time series utilizes the following data
sources:</p>
<ul>
<li>USGS (no specifics on what USGS data is used, or how to access)</li>
<li>DWR (no specifics on what DWR data is used, or how to access)</li>
<li>USACE (no specifics on what USACE data is used, or how to
access)</li>
<li>Reclamation (no specifics on what Reclamation data is used, or how
to access)</li>
<li>Data stored in text files as part of DWR’s “COMP” model (no
specifics on what COMP model data is used, or how to access)</li>
</ul>
<p>These data sources are not described in depth and no links to the
sources are provided in the CalSim 3 main report.</p>
<p>When there are gaps in gage data or there is no available gage data
for a rim watershed, a synthetic timeseries was developed using a linear
interpolation approach (when there is some gage data, but only for a
limited timeseries) or a S-Curve Method (Percent Deviation Method) to
scale flow based on a similar watershed (when there is no gage data
available from any time period).
