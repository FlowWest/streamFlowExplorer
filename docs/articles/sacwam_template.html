<p>SacWAM simplifies the depiction of stream flows by aggregating
surface water diversions, return flows, and groundwater inflows to the
stream network.</p>
<p>SacWAM simulates the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>unimpaired flows (the amount of what would flow down a river in the
absence of dams and diversions)</li>
<li>stream flows throughout the Sacramento and Delta Eastside Tributary
Watersheds</li>
<li>stream flows at United States Geological Survey (USGS) and
California Department of Water Resources (DWR) gauges located on the
Sacramento River</li>
<li>Delta inflow, net Delta outflow, and flows within the south
Delta</li>
<li>major water infrastructure and storage regulation</li>
<li>water allocations, diversions, and return flows on the valley

</h3>
<p>The following sections describe key model components.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="weap">WEAP<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#weap"></a>
</h4>
<p>The Water Evaluation and Planning system (WEAP) provides the modeling
framework and software for SacWAM. WEAP is a simulation model that
includes robust and flexible representation of water demands and the
ability to program infrastructure elements nested within underlying
hydrological processes.</p>
<p>WEAP is organized into five views:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Schematic View</strong> - spatial layout of the model is
created, edited, viewed</li>
<li>
<strong>Data View</strong> - hierarchical tree that organizes
modeling data into six categories: Key Assumptions, Demand Sites and
Catchments, Hydrology, Supply and Resources, Water Quality, Other
Assumptions, User-Defined LP Constraints</li>
<li>
<strong>Results View</strong> - display of all model outputs in
customizable tables and charts</li>
<li>
<strong>Scenario Explorer View</strong> - results or data across
many scenarios can be grouped together to show relative impacts of
multiple scenarios</li>
<li>
<strong>Notes View</strong> - documentation</li>
</ul>
<div class="section level5">
<h5 id="water-allocation">Water Allocation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#water-allocation"></a>
</h5>
<p>Demand priorities and supply preferences are used to determine
allocations of water supplies.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Demand priority</strong> - attached to demand site,
catchment, reservoir, or flow requirement. Ranges from 1 (highest
priority) to 99 (lowest priority). Demand sites can share the same
priority (during times of shortage supplies shared equally). When demand
sites or catchments are connected to more than one supply source, supply
preferences determine the order of withdrawal.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Supply preferences</strong> - Used to determine order of
withdrawal when demand sites or catchments are connected to more than
one supply source. Ranges from 1 (highest priority) to 99 (lowest
priority). Assignment of preferences usually reflects economic,
environmental, historical, legal, and/or political realities.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>WEAP must assess available water supplies at each time step. Built-in
reservoir routines control the release of stored water which impact the
available water supplies.</p>
<ul>
<li>Flood control zone - evacuated so that volume of water cannot exceed
top of conservation zone</li>
<li>Conservation zone - available to meet water requirements in
full</li>
<li>Buffer zone - depends on buffer coefficient (fraction of water in
zone available each month for release) to conserve the reservoir’s
dwindling supplies</li>
<li>Inactive zone - not used for allocations</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section level5">
<h5 id="hydrology">Hydrology<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#hydrology"></a>
</h5>
<p>SacWAM is made up of spatially continuous catchments that cover the
entire extent of the river basin overlayed with water management network
of rivers, canals, reservoirs, demand centers, aquifers, and other
feathers. Each catchment is divided into independent land use classes
that sum to 100 percent of the catchment.</p>
<p>Hydrological processes in SacWAM use two approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>Soil moisture methods - used in the Upper Watersheds to represent
rainfall-runoff processes. Used here because of ability to simulate snow
accumulation and melt processes.</li>
<li>MABAIA method - used on the Valley floor to represent agricultural
crops and irrigation management. Allows user to specify several
irrigation parameters.</li>
</ul>
<p>SacWAM can be run in two modes:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>WEAP catchment objects are used to simulate snow accumulation, snow
melt, and rainfall-runoff processes</li>
<li>Time series of historical unimpaired flows (developed by DWR) used
to represent flows from the upper watersheds into the stream
network</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section level5">
<h5 id="solution-methodology">Solution Methodology<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#solution-methodology"></a>
</h5>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Compute horizontal and vertical fluxes using the catchment
objects</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>These are then passed to each river and groundwater object</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Water allocations made by passing constraints to linear programming
optimization routine that maximizes demand <em>satisfaction</em>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>All flows assumed to occur instantaneously: withdraw water, use
water, and return water within the same timestep. Model timestep should
be at least the length of the water residence time in study area.</li>
<li>Mixed integer linear programming (MILP) used to solve allocations
which allows multiple demands with the same priority to be allocated
supplies equally and suspends allocation of lower priority groups until
the first group is met. The user can also constrain flow through any
transmission link. -The MILP is iteratively solved to maximize
preferences and is then applied to the next Equity Group, and then the
process is repeated at the next time step.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="system-components">System Components<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#system-components"></a>
</h4>
<p>Watersheds in SacWAM are categorized as either Upper or Valley Floor
watersheds. No single source of information used to delineate
watersheds:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upper: foothill and mountain watersheds characterized by steep
slopes, shallow soils, limited aquifer, not developed</li>
<li>Valley Floor: located between Upper watersheds and Delta;
extensively developed, highly managed, rich agricultural land, urban
areas</li>
</ul>
<p>The following <em>System Components</em> are defined in SacWAM:</p>
<ul>
<li>rivers and diversions - aerial imagery used to trace hydrologic
features (river miles and canal miles), and identify points of
diversion. Rule: unidirectional upstream to downstream, may not divide
into two or more distributaries. Diversion arcs used for manmade canals
as well as canal losses (groundwater or evaporation), water treatment
plant intake, bias correction, delta depletions, stream losses,
consumptive use.</li>
<li>reservoirs - reservoirs with storage capacity greater than 50,000 AF
and/or used for hydropower are represented in SacWAM. Smaller reservoirs
may also be included to define points of diversion.</li>
<li>groundwater - ten groundwater basins are simulated. Inflows and
outflows include deep percolation from demand catchment, return flows
from urban demand sites, seepage losses on surface water distribution
systems, interaction with stream network through groundwater inflow and
outflow parameters, groundwater pumping to meet water demands.</li>
<li>other suppliers - limited to San Joaquin valley and provide water to
lands on southern boundary</li>
<li>demand site - represents urban water demands and deliveries to water
users located outside model domain</li>
<li>catchments - valley floor domain divided into smaller geographic
regions known as Water Budget Areas (WBA). WBAs represent a single water
demand or those who rely on groundwater/self-produced water; and defines
spatial resolution of hydrologic input data. There are 25 WBAs
(aggregated versions of the WBAs defined by DWR); except for 61N where
SacWAM only represents the area north of the Stanislaus</li>
<li>runoff and infiltration</li>
<li>transmission links - connect water supplies to demands (Demand Site
objects and Catchment objects)</li>
<li>Central Valley Project deliveries - settlement contractors, exchange
contractors, water right holders in San Joaquin valley, M&amp;I water
service contractors, wildlife refuges</li>
<li>water treatment plants - represented indirectly using combination of
diversion arcs and transmission links</li>
<li>wastewater treatment plants - there is an object but it is mostly
not used</li>
<li>return flows - associated with urban Demand Units and represents
discharge of treated wastewater to surface water or underlying
aquifer</li>
<li>flow requirements - Instream Flow Requirement object: REG flow
requirements that are regulatory, OPS flow requirements used to drive
simulated upstream storage or simulated diversions, SWRCB potential new
regulatory flow requirements specified as fraction of unimpaired
flow</li>
<li>run of river hydro plants - simulate hydropower genertation, not
used in SacWAM, represented with diversion arcs</li>
<li>streamflow gages - allow rapid comparison of simulated flows to
historical observed data. HIS means historical observed, FNF for full
natural flow data, EST have been estimated from a water balance based on
reservoir releases</li>
<li>dummy arcs and nodes - priority based constraints (constraints
activated or inactivated to an assigned priority), switches,
minimization, maximization</li>
</ul>

<p>SacWAM uses stream flow gage data to facilitate assessment of model
performance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Historical (HIS): Obtained from USGS, DWR Water Library, DWR
CDEC</li>
<li>Full natural flows (FNF) - Calculated flow that would be in river
without upstream infrastructure</li>
<li>Estimated (EST) - Added where historical flows cannot be estimated
from downstream gages</li>

<p>SacWAM uses additional models to generate agricultural water
inputs:</p>
<ul>
<li>MABIA method for crop ET</li>
<li>SCS curve for rainfall-runoff</li>
<li>Sacramento - San Joaquin Basin Study (Reclamation, 2014C) for crop
coefficients</li>
<li>NRCS lower quarter method (average of lowest quarter of the
distribution to the average of the distribution) for defining
distribution uniformity</li>

<p><strong>Coverage</strong> The model includes the entire
Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (Delta), and the Delta Eastside streams
comprising the Cosumnes, Mokelumne, and Calaveras rivers. SacWAM also
includes the Delta-Mendota Canal, California Aqueduct, and San Luis
Reservoir. Flows in the San Joaquin River entering the SacWAM model
domain at Vernalis are specified based a CalSim 3 simulation by Stantec
in 2022. SacWAM represents the water resources within the model domain
using a comprehensive approach in which hydrology, water infrastructure,
and water management are all contained within the simulation model.</p>

</h2>
<p>SacWAM is a good model to use for a Sacramento Valley Wide Analysis
because it has good coverage of the system and can model how different
operations would cause different flow at a relatively fine scale.
However, SacWAM produces results at a monthly time scale is limited for
use in biological modeling. Monthly timestep flow data does not capture
the fine scale resolution that biological organisms experience.</p>

<ul>
<li>Groundwater pumping considered at field elevation and not subject to
losses</li>
<li>No reuse of operational spills and lateral flows</li>
<li>Scaling land use: 10-year historical average for wheat in DAU X =
10,000 acres; GIS data from the land use mosaic shows 8,000 acres of
wheat in DAU X; GIS data from the land use mosaic shows 500 acres of
wheat in DU A; If DU A is located withing DAU X, the existing level
acreage for wheat = 500 * (10,000/8,000) acres</li>
